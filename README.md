## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why It Was Used |
|---|---|---|
| 🖥️ **Backend** | Java 21 + Spring Boot | Spring Boot is the gold standard for building production-grade REST APIs in Java. It offers auto-configuration, embedded server, and a massive ecosystem — perfect for quickly scaffolding a robust backend. |
| 🤖 **AI Engine** | Google Gemini API | Gemini provides state-of-the-art language understanding and generation capabilities. It's free-tier friendly, fast, and produces high-quality text — ideal for generating natural-sounding email replies. |
| 🔴 **Caching** | Upstash Redis | Upstash is a managed, serverless Redis service. It caches email replies so repeated requests are served instantly without hitting the Gemini API again — saving rate limit quota and improving speed. |
| 🐳 **Containerization** | Docker | Docker ensures the app runs identically across all environments. The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build to keep the final image small and production-ready. |
| ☁️ **Deployment** | Render | Render supports Docker-based deployments out of the box and offers a free tier for hobby projects. The `render.yaml` enables Infrastructure-as-Code style deployments for easy CI/CD. |

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
User Request (Chrome Extension)
        ↓
Redis Cache? ──HIT──→ Instant reply ✅ (0 API calls used)
        ↓ MISS
ApiKeyRotator picks next key (round-robin)
        ↓
Try Key 1 → fails? → Try Key 2 → fails? → Try Key 3 ✅
        ↓
Gemini API generates reply
        ↓
Store in Redis Cache (TTL: 1 hour)
        ↓
Return reply to user ✅
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+ (or 21)
- Maven (or use the included `mvnw` wrapper)
- 5x Google Gemini API Keys ([Get one here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))
- Upstash Redis account ([Sign up here](https://upstash.com))

---

### 🔧 Local Setup (Without Docker)

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshaadeshmukh/MailCraft.git
cd MailCraft
```

**2. Set Environment Variables in IntelliJ**

Go to **Run → Edit Configurations → Environment Variables** and add:
```
GEMINI_API_URL   = https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com
GEMINI_API_KEYS  = key1,key2,key3,key4,key5 and so on
REDIS_HOST       = your-upstash-host
REDIS_PORT       = 6379
REDIS_PASSWORD   = your-upstash-password
```

**3. Build and run**
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
> On Windows, use `mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run`

**4. Open the app**

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## 🌐 API Reference

### Generate Email Reply

**`POST /api/email/generate`**

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "emailContent": "Hi, I wanted to follow up on our meeting from last week...",
  "tone": "Professional"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "reply": "Dear [Name],\n\nThank you for reaching out. I appreciate your follow-up regarding our recent meeting..."
}
```

**Error Response (all keys exhausted):**
```
Status: 503
Body: "⏳ All keys are busy. Please try again in a minute."
```

---

## ☁️ Deployment on Render

**1.** Push your code to GitHub

**2.** Go to [render.com](https://render.com) → **New Web Service** → connect your repo

**3.** Set these environment variables in Render dashboard:
```
GEMINI_API_URL   = https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com
GEMINI_API_KEYS  = key1,key2,key3,key4,key5
REDIS_HOST       = your-upstash-host
REDIS_PORT       = 6379
REDIS_PASSWORD   = your-upstash-password
```

**4.** Render auto-builds the Docker image and deploys ✅

## 🔑 API Key Rotation — How It Works

MailCraft treats API keys like server instances behind a load balancer — **horizontal scaling applied to API keys.**

```
                  ┌─── Key 1 (15 req/min) ───┐
                  │                           │
Request ──→ ApiKeyRotator ─── Key 2 (15 req/min) ───→ Gemini API
                  │                           │
                  └─── Key 3 (15 req/min) ───┘

Total capacity = 15 req/min × number of keys
```

- Uses `AtomicInteger` for thread-safe round-robin selection
- If one key fails → automatically tries the next key
- 5 keys = **75 requests/min, 7500 requests/day** — completely free ✅
